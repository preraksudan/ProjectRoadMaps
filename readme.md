## Solopreneur Roadmap: An Interactive Learning Dashboard

This project is a single-page interactive web application that transforms a comprehensive report on becoming a fullstack and DevOps solopreneur into an engaging, explorable learning roadmap. It's designed to be a dynamic alternative to a static document, allowing users to navigate skills, compare technologies, and understand key concepts through interactive visualizations.

### Features

  - **Interactive Skill Tree:** A clickable sidebar that allows you to explore detailed information about different skills in the Fullstack and DevOps paths.
  - **Dynamic Visualizations:** Interactive charts powered by **Chart.js** illustrate complex data, such as a comparison of frontend frameworks and an overview of pricing models.
  - **Responsive Design:** Built with **Tailwind CSS**, the application provides a seamless and intuitive user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
  - **Single-Page Architecture:** All content and logic are contained within a single `index.html` file for simplicity and ease of hosting.

### Customization and Contribution

This project is built to be easily customizable. All the data for the roadmap, including the content for the skill tree and charts, is stored in a simple JavaScript object (`roadmapData`) at the bottom of the `index.html` file. You can modify this data directly to update the content of the application.
